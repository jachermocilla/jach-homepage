		<h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		<i>Student's Guide to the Special Problem</i> was written for 
		undergraduate Computer Science students who are going to enroll
		or are currently enrolled in CMSC 190 (Special Problem). 
		My motivation for writing this guide is to help students by giving 
		them some guidelines on how to succesfully complete the course. 
		A lot of students are delayed from graduating because they never 
		finish this course within the prescribed period. The guidelines 
		presented here can at least give them some sense of direction on 
		how to complete CMSC 190.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="purpose">2. The Purpose of the SP</h3>
		<p>
		The Special Problem is almost equivalent to a thesis. However, unlike
		a thesis which is more theoretical, the SP is more of application. 
		<u>The main purpose of the SP is for you to prove that you are capable 
		of formulating your own problem (the SP) and developing a solution 
		(in a form of software) for the problem</u>. Doing your SP involves
		independent study where you get to apply the things you learned from 
		other courses or from your own effort. Ideally, you should be able to
		apply everything that you learned in doing your SP. However, majority 
		will come from	your programming, database, and software engineering 
		classes. 
		</p>
		<p>The scope of the SP should be broader compared to the projects you 
		have worked	on	in regular courses. Since the SP is done individually, 
		defining the scope is a challenge and should be done with your adviser.
		The SP is essentially a software development project and thus, the 
		software	development process applies. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The SP is done in two stages (in line with its purpose):
		proposal(1 unit credit) and implementation (2 units credit). 
		These two stages are distributed in two semesters during the 
		fourth year of your stay in the university.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="adviser">3. Choosing your Adviser</h3>
		<p>
		The adviser is a faculty member who will mentor you as you do your SP.
		Ideally, you
		need to select an adviser who shares the same interest with you. 
		Each faculty in the institute has his/her own field of specialization. 
		However, many students avoid advisers who are "experts" in a field 
		because they are scared to be reprimanded when they commit mistakes. 
		Reprimands should be taken	lightly and constructively. 
		</p>
		<p>
		If you cannot find a faculty member who specializes in your interests, 
		look for	a senior faculty member because they have more experience
		in advising	than junior	faculty members. On the other hand, junior 
		faculty members tend to be more approachable than senior faculty members.
		Also, senior faculty members are busy with other administrative duties,
		thus it is easier to get help from junior faculty members. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The amount of support you receive will vary depending
		on who your adviser is.	Some advisers are good in managing their advisees. 
		They make themselves available to you throughout the entire process and 
		provides help every step of the way. If you find yourself under this kind
		of adviser, consider yourself lucky. Other advisers allow their advisees
		to work independently and present only significant results near the end 
		of the semester. If you do not like presenting minor progress, this kind
		of adviser is for you.
		 
		</p>

		<h3 id="topic">4. Finding a Topic</h3>
		<p>
		A lot of students are having a hard time in finding topics for their SP.
		To get you started, ask questions.
		<ul>
			<li>What is my favorite computer science subject?Why do I like it? 
			Are there "advanced" topics that were not covered in the lecture?
			</li>	
			<li>What technologies are "in" today?</li>	
			<li>What if I write a compiler for my own PL?</li>	
		</ul>
		Reading the SP manuscripts of previous students, specially the 
		recommendation section, will also help. You might want to search the web
		for interesting topics. One method I use is to visit the websites of 
		Computer Science departments of popular schools like MIT, Stanford, 
		and CMU. I then look for ideas in the research section of their websites. 
		You can also apply as a student assistant at the institute. A lot of 
		ideas are just lying around waiting for your ear to hear, especially when 
		the faculty members are having discussions. If you have a vague topic
		in mind, you can browse through related conferences proceedings and
		journals.
  		</p>
		<p>
		General categories of SP topics:
		<ul>
			<li>Performance Analysis <i>(Algo X perform better than Algo Y)</i>
			</li>
			<li>Web/Database Applications <i>(ICS Library Online DB)</i></li>
			<li>Computer Aided Instruction <i>(Kiddie Tool, Projectile 
				Motion Visualization in 3D)</i>
			</li>
			<li>Algorithm Visualization <i>(Turing Machine Simulator)</i></li>
			<li>Mobile Applications <i>(SMS Gateway/Bluetooth//PDA Apps)</i></li>
			<li>Machine Vision <i>(Fire Detection)</i></li>
			<li>Application Frameworks/Libraries <i>(PHP App frameworks)</i></li>
			<li>Systems Programming <i>(Linux device driver for some old hardware)
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>Graphics and Games <i>(MMORPG, 3D Rendering Engines)</i></li>
			<li>Networking/Security <i>(Encrypted File Transfer)</i></li>
			<li>Tools <i>(IDE, Schema Normalizer,CASE Tools)</i></li>
			<li>Artificial Intelligence <i>(Neural Nets, Expert Systems, Robotics)
			</i></li>
		</ul>	
		</p>
		<p>
		Doing your SP involves a lot of independent work. Make sure that
		you are really interested in the topic that you are working on so
		that you will not lose interest in it later.
		</p>
		<p>
		You will also need a good title for your SP. Make sure that your title
		tells all of what you are going to do or accomplish. Make sure that it is
		catchy and relevant.

			Performance Analysis of Sorting Algorithms on a Random Sequence of Integers
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		<h3 id="proposal">5. Writing the Proposal</h3>
		<p>
		Your proposal describes and defines the problem that you are going to 
		work on. It is	presented to a panel of three faculty members (one of
		which is your adviser) for approval as a SP. The panelists evaluate the
		scope, complexity, relevance, and practicality of your proposal. If your
		proposal is approved, then you can move on to the implementation stage, 
		otherwise you may	need to revise it and present again. Writing your SP
		proposal is as challenging as finding a topic, you will need technical 
		writing skills. 
		</p>
		<p>
		A proposal is composed of six sections: <i>Introduction, Objectives, 
		Review of Related Literature, Theoretical Framework, Methodology, and 
		Bibliography</i>. The content of each section is discussed below.
		</p>
		<h5>Introduction</h5>
		<p>
		This section gives a short overview of your chosen topic. It is further
		divided into two subsections: <i>Background of the Study</i> and 
		<i>Statement of the Problem</i>.<i> Background of the Study</i> should 
		discuss the	relevance of your topic, answering the question of why is the problem 
		worth solving. You can also mention a brief history here. In the 
		<i>Statement of the Problem</i> subsection, you state your problem 
		concisely in one or two sentences.

		<pre>
			Several algorithms, with varying performance characteristics, for 
			sorting a given sequence of numbers have been invented in the past
			two decades...Emperical analysis will show the actual performance
			of a sorting algorithm in practice.
					
			...This study will compare the performance of sorting algorithms on a
			randomly generated sequence of integers.
		</pre>

		<p>
		<h5>Objectives</h5>
		<p>
		In this section you state what you want to accomplish. First state the
		general objective then the specific objectives. Your results after
		the implementation should achieve the objectives you stated.
		<pre>
			The general objective of this study is to compare the performance
			of different sorting algorithms on a randomly generated sequence
			of integers. 
			Specific objectives:
			1)to write a program that generates a random sequence of integers;
			2)to implement sorting algorithms (Bubblesort,Quicksort,Heapsort);
			3)to use the randomly generated sequence of numbers as input on the
			sorting algorithms
		</pre> 
		</p>
		<h5>Review of Related Literature</h5>
		<p>
		In this section, you describe works of others that are in some way 
		related to what you are working on. You can mention the strengths and
		limitations of their approach to solving the problem. Normally, each
		related work is presented chronologically, from the oldest to the latest.
		Thus, do not forget to mention the year and the name of the researchers.
		<pre>
			In the past, comparative analysis of algorithms....
			...In 1976, Belviz conducted a comparative analysis of search
			algorithms using different data structures. He observed that BS
			performs better than LS in some input cases. However, the main 
			limitation of Belviz' approach was... 
		</pre>
		</p>

		<h5>Theoretical Framework</h5>
		<p>
		In this section, you discuss in detail the underlying theories that you 
		will use. Definitions, theorems, lemmas,  proofs, algorithms, among 
		others should be stated. Relevant technologies and architectural design
		can also be	described.
		<pre>
			The sorting problem is defined as finding a permutation...
			Theorem 1. The worst case running time of Bubblesort is O(n^2).
			Proof:	
				Let n...
		</pre>
		</p>
	
		<h5>Methodology</h5>
		<p>
		The <i>Methodology</i> section should describe the approach you are 
		going to take to solve the problem. You can use the software development
		lifecycle as an outline: Requirements, Design, Implementation, and 
		Testing. A timeline is also required in this section. You can use a
		Gantt chart for this at least at the week level granularity. At the 
		proposal stage, you should write the methodology in future tense.
		<pre>
			The study will use the incremental and iterative approach...
			The tests will be conducted on a Pentium 4 computer with 512MB RAM...
		</pre>
		</p>
		
		<h5>Bibliography</h5>
		<p>
		In this section, you cite the references you used in writing the 
		proposal. There is no standard, as far as I know, on the format for
		citing references.
		</p>

		<h3 id="implementation">6. Implementation</h3>
		<p>
		The implementation stage is where you actually begin the analysis,
		design, implementation, and testing phases of the software development 
		lifecycle. At this stage, you should review your software engineering
		course. It is sad to say that majority of the software produced by 
		students are not following sound software engineering practices. I
		think this is because the panelists do not look at the source code
		but only on the output. The following are tips to help you at this stage.
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>As much as possible, use linux as the development 
			environment.</i>
			There are a lot of software development tools that you can use in 
			linux. Also you will not get distracted to play games.
			</li>
			<li><i>Follow a coding convention</i>. Coding conventions make your
			code more readable.
			</li>
			<li><i>Learn how to use a Version Control System such as CVS or SVN
			</i>. There 
			are occasions when you might break your code (introduce bugs). When
			your source code is under a VCS, you can easily revert back to the 
			less buggy version.
			</li>
			<li><i>Create reusable code, if you hate typing, copying and pasting
			</i>.
			A lot of code, especially in web applications are redundant. Learn
			to identify the redundant code and turn them into functions that
			you can just call.
			</li>
			<li><i>KISS(Keep It Simple Stupid)</i></li>
			<li><i>Learn how to package your software</i>. A lot of software
			produced	by students cannot be installed and configured in other 
			computers.
			</li>
			<li><i>Apply unit testing. </i>Make sure that the individual units
			of code are properly tested. You can use a unit testing framework
			like JUnit.
			</li>
			<li><i>Learn design patterns.</i>Certain design problems
			have corresponding designs that are effective and elegant.
			
			</li>
		</ul>
		You might encounter technical problems at this stage. Make sure that
		you consult your adviser regularly.
		</p>

		<h3 id="manuscript">7. Writing the final manuscript</h3>
		<p>
		The final manuscript will be based on your proposal. If there are minor
		changes in the scope and in the objectives, they should be reflected
		in the final manuscript. The final manuscript will contain the same
		sections as the proposal with the addition of the <i>
		Results and Discussion, Conclusion,and	Recommendations and Future Work
		</i> sections. Another change that must be made in the final proposal
		is the tense used in the methodology section, from future tense to 
		past tense.
		</p>

		<h5>Methodology</h5>
		<pre>
			The study used the incremental and iterative approach...
			The tests were conducted on a Pentium 4 computer with 512MB RAM...
		</pre>

		<h5>Results and Discussion</h5>
		<p>
		In this section, you describe the results of your implementation.
		You can include discussions of typical use cases for your software.
		If your SP is about comparative analysis, you can discuss the performance
		of the algorithms you used, and if possible present a graph. The results 
		should achieve the objectives you set in the proposal.
		<pre>
			A program that generates a random sequence of integers was created...
			After the execution of the sorting algorithms using the randomly
			generated sequence of integers as input, the number of comparisons made by
			each algorithm was recorded...The result shows the Quicksort has
			the...This may be due the the partition step of the algorithm...
		</pre>
		</p>	
		<h5>Conclusion</h5>
		<p>
		In three to five sentences, make a summary of what you have 
		accomplished in your SP.
		<pre>
			This study has shown, by experimental results, that Quicksort is the...
		</pre>
		</p>
		<h5>Recommendations and Future Work</h5>
		<p>
		State in this section the things that you would like to improve later
		on if given the time and resources.
		<pre>
			The main drawback of the analysis is the use of simplifying assumptions..
			It is possible that by relaxing these, a more significant result will
			be obtained.
		</pre>	
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="defense">8. Defending your SP</h3>
		<p>
		The final stage of the SP is the defense. The purpose of the defense is
		to present the results of your study to a panel of faculty members. 
		The panel will then evaluate your output and decide whether it is 
		substantial for you to get a final grade. The only way to a successful
		defense is preparation. First, make sure that your adviser approves that
		you present to a panel. Your adviser's approval will contribute a lot
		to the success of your defense. Never present an incomplete SP.
