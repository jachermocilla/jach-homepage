               <td><b>Implementation and Evaluation of Selected Image Processing Algorithms for Single and Distributed Processors</b><br/><br/>
                  Many applications such as medical imaging, security systems and active vision of autonomous vehicles use image processing. It is gaining a larger importance to some of these applications. However, the size of the images varies from very small to very large. The problem arises when processing a very large image size, which is often encountered, and requires a significantly small amount of processing time and real-time constraints have to be met. And for these reasons, development and implementation of parallel algorithms can be used for a more efficient image processing.<br/><br/>
                  This problem focuses on the significant figures gained through parallel implementation of selected image processing routines compared to the common sequential algorithms done by single processors. It will provide some of the known routines in image processing (some would be point, global, and local operators; edge detection, Hough transform, Fast Fourier Transform, etc.) along with some of the different algorithms for each of them, implementing them on single and distributed processors. Though many known routines and algorithms exist, not all of them will be used as such the time to implement all of them for the given time duration of this proposal is not feasible. Supplementary time analysis between sequential and parallel executions will be shown although not necessarily as to the extent of deeper explanation of their time complexities.
